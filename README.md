# Bat-Mitzvah-Project


This project was done for a party, where the users wanted a way to visualize the scores of four different organizations.
As they input the scores, the animated bar graph updates to show the progress, and clearly indicates the leading organization.

Some credit is definitely due to google :-) , and https://github.com/lampieg/LiveGraph for the basis of code.
